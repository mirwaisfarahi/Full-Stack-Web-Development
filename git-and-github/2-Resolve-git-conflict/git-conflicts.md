# Merge Conflicts in Git
When you work with multiple branches, sooner or later you will experience a git merge conflict. Usually, git is smart enough to merge changes from different branches, but when more than one person makes other changes in exactly the same place, git needs a decision from a human.

## Why is this important?
Merge conflicts can be a little bit scary at the beginning. However, they are a natural consequence of working with a team. There is a big chance that you will experience merge conflicts while working in a team.
