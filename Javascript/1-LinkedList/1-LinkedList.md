# LinkedList: 
A collection of linked nodes (Node: a container that contains some data)

## Advantages of Linked List over array
1. Insert Operation: Time complexity for insertion in array is O(n) because we need to shift all elements to right side and put our new element in that position.
2. Time complexity is O(1) in LinkedList because of only changing two pointers all the time and it is constant amount of time.

## Operations on LinkedList
The operations are done in LinkedListOperation.js file and practice.js file
