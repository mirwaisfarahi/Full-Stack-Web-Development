## Why is clean code important?
> There is not a single coding style or a rigid set of rules that every programmer should follow. Given the number of existing programming languages, paradigms, and personal styles, that's simply impossible. But there are some principles that the community has embraced, independent of the language you are working in. Some of the most popular are:

- DRY: Don't repeat yourself! It simply means you should try to avoid having duplicated code. Instead, you should reuse your code when possible. Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system (Andrew Hunt & David Thomas, "The Pragmatic Programmer").

- KISS: Keep It Simple, Stupid. No further explanation is needed! Try to avoid unnecessary complexity, don't over-engineer your code. A simple, small, and easy-to understand code base is easier to maintain and scale.

- YAGNI: You Aren't Gonna Need It. Don't add anything you don't strictly need. Try to avoid the temptation of adding the most trendy technologies just because you think they may be useful in the future. Add things gradually, when they are really needed.
